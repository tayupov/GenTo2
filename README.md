# GenTo2

GenTo is a platform that facilitates Initial Coins Offerings. It creates user-defined Smart Contracts and automatically deploys them to the blockchain â€“ without the need to write a single line of code!

Hiding technical details from the user, we make Initial Coin Offerings accessible for a broader, non-technical audience. GenTo provides an intuitive web-based UI that guides the user through the contract creation process step by step.

GenTo has been developed by a student group at the chair for Information Systems Engineering at Technical University of Berlin in collaboration with venture capitalist and startup advisor Globumbus.
